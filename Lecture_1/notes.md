# Notes lecture 1
A structure is a set of eements, relations, and properties
A structure provides a perspective for reasoning about system properties, e.g. modifiability, performance and availability

## Types of views
<b>Module View:</b>

Implementation units such as code or data

Static system structure, functional responisibility of modules. Relationships among modules. 

- Classes
- Layers
- Implementation


<b>Component and Connector View:</b>

Component and their interaction at runtime. 

Components are units such as services, servers, filters or other runtime elements.
Connectors are the communication among components


Components
- Processes
- Services
- Objects
- Clients
- Servers
- Data stores

Connectors
- Service Invocations, 
- async message queues, 
- streams.

<b>Allocation View:</b>

Mapping from software structures to non software structures.

Non software structure such as processor, disk, file etc.

Compare required properties of software to provided properties (read: environment)



Example:
- Component requires 5 ms response time
